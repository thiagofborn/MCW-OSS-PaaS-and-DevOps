# OSS PaaS and DevOps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement a solution for integrating and deploying complex open-source software (OSS) workloads into Azure PaaS. You migrate an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application from a hosted environment into Azure Web App for Containers, migrate a MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB, enhance application functionality using serverless technologies, and fully embrace modern DevOps tools.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to migrate and deploy OSS applications into Azure PaaS using modern DevOps methodologies and Docker containers.

## Overview

Best For You Organics Company is one of the leading online health food suppliers in North America, serving customers in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. They launched their highly-successful e-commerce website, which sells subscriptions to their meal service, in 2016, and have been steadily increasing their subscriber-base since. Their service caters to working professionals looking for convenient, reliable access to healthy meal choices, and pre-packaged recipes without having to spend too much time preparing the meals.

Their CIO is a big proponent of open-source software, and their web application uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.JS, Node.js). They host their code in a private GitHub repository. They currently have a continuous integration workflow, triggered by each code check-in/commit in GitHub, using Jenkins.

As their service has grown, they have found that the management of VM and server infrastructure is a real challenge. They want to learn more about how Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions for OSS applications on Azure might be able to help. Their goal is to focus their expenditures and efforts on their core business, rather than infrastructure. The development team at Best For You Organics has indicated they have some experience with Docker. They are interested in what options might be available for using containers to deploy their application into a cloud environment. They are also interested in learning more about identity management.

The development team has also expressed that they would like to continue using GitHub as their code repository but is interested in improving upon their DevOps pipeline. They currently use Jenkins for their builds and are interested in any tools available in a cloud offering that could help with release management, or other aspects of a fully-integrated, modern DevOps pipeline. Ultimately, their goal is to automate and simplify deployments through CI/CD capabilities and deliver updates faster and more reliably.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This diagram consists of icons that are connected by arrows. On the left, the Developer icon (VS Code) points linearly to the GitHub Repo and Jenkins icons. The previous two icons are enclosed in a box labeled CI/CD Pipeline. Jenkins points to Web App for Containers on the right. Various arrows point from Web App for Containers to Azure Container Registry (a double-sided arrow); Logic Apps (a linear arrow that also points from Logic Apps to Customers); Customers (a linear arrow); and Azure Cosmos DB (a double-sided arrow that also points from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Functions with another double-sided arrow).](media/solution-architecture-diagram.png "Solution architecture diagram")

The solution begins with developers using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as their code editor. In VS Code, they can leverage rich integrations with GitHub, Docker, and Azure. From a high level, developers will package the entire OSS application inside a custom Docker container using the Docker extension in VS Code. The image will be pushed to an Azure Container Registry as part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub and Jenkins. This Docker image will then be deployed to a Web App for Containers instance, as part of their continuous delivery process using The Azure App Service Jenkins plugin.

The MongoDB database will be imported into Azure Cosmos DB, using mongoimport.exe, and access the database from the application will continue to use the MongoDB APIs. The database connection string in the application will be updated to point to the new Cosmos DB.

Serverless architecture is applied to order processing and customer notifications. Azure Functions are used to automate the processing of orders, billing credit cards, and updating the database as order processing is completed. Logic Apps are applied to send SMS notifications via a Twilio connector to customers, informing them that their order has been processed and shipped.

In this hands-on lab, you will assist them with completing the OSS application and database migrations into Azure. You will implement a containerized solution. For this, you will create a custom Docker image and push it to an Azure Container Registry. You will then configure a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application to a Web App for Containers instance. You will also help them implement functionality enhancements using serverless architecture services in Azure.

### Task 2: Grant permissions to Docker

In this task, you will grant permissions to the _demouser_ account to access the Unix socket needed to communicate with the Docker engine.

1. On your Lab VM, open a **Bash** shell by selecting the Start menu and then expanding Debian, Applications, and Shells.

   ![In the Lab VM start menu, Debian -> Applications -> Shells is expanded, and Bash is highlighted in the Shells menu.](media/labvm-menu-bash-shell.png "Start menu")

2. At the command prompt, enter the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
   ```

3. After running the command, reboot the Lab VM using the following command at the bash shell:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. Log back in using the same credentials:

   - **Username:** demouser
   - **Password:** Password.1!!

5. After logging back in, relaunch the bash shell and run the following command to test that the demouser account has proper permissions:

   ```bash
   docker run hello-world
   ```

   ![Screenshot of the bash shell command sudo usermod -a pG docker $USER output. Includes output from running the test command, docker run hello-world.](media/bash-docker-hello-world.png "Bash Shell")

### Task 3: Integrate GitHub into VS Code

In this task, you will install the GitHub extension in VS Code and configure a service integration with your GitHub account. This integration will allow you to push your code changes to GitHub directly from VS Code.

1. On your Lab VM, open **VS Code** under Programming on the Start menu.

   ![Visual Studio Code is highlighted under Programming on the start menu.](media/labvm-menu-programming-vscode.png "Visual Studio Code")

17. VS Code is now connected to your GitHub account.

18. Close VS Code.

### Task 4: Clone the starter application

In this task, you will clone the starter application, creating a local copy on your Lab VM.

1. On your Lab VM, open a browser and navigate to your GitHub account (<https://github.com>).

2. Within your GitHub account, navigate to the forked copy of the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-Devops` application page, select **Clone or download**, then select the **copy** link next to the web URL.

   ![The Clone or download button is selected on the forked copy of the MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-Devops application page, and the web URL is displayed below it.](media/github-clone.png "Select Clone or download")

3. Open a new bash shell, and enter the following command:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```

4. Next, enter the following command, replacing `[EMAIL]` with the email address you used when creating your GitHub account. This will associate your git email address with the commits made from the Lab VM.

   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "[EMAIL]"
   ```

   ![The above command to associate your git email address with the commits made from the Lab VM is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/bash-git-config.png "bash terminal window")

5. At the prompt, enter the following command, replacing `[CLONE-URL]` with URL you copied from GitHub in step 2 above:

>**Change #01:** To avoid issues with permissions. Clone than change owner.

   ```bash
   git clone [CLONE-URL]
   sudo chown -R demouser:demouser ./MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps
   ```

   ![The git clone command is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/bash-git-clone.png "bash terminal window")

6. Now, change the directory to the cloned project by entering the following at the prompt:

   ```bash
   cd MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps
   ```

   ![The command to change the directory is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/bash-cd-mcw-oss-paas-and-devops.png "bash terminal window")

7. Finally, issue a command to open the starter project in VS Code by typing:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

8. A new VS Code window will open, with the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` folder opened.

   ![The MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-Devops folder is open in the Explorer pane in the Visual Studio Code window, and the Welcome pane is open on the right.](media/vscode-mcw-oss-paas-and-devops.png "Visual Studio Code window")

9. You are now ready to begin working with the project in VS Code.

### Task 5: Launch the starter application

In this task, you will seed the MongoDB with sample data, then run the application locally, connected to your MongoDB instance. This task is to verify the connection to MongoDB and that it contains the seeded plan data before we migrate the application and data to Azure Cosmos DB.

1. Return to VS Code, select **Terminal** from the menu, and select **New Terminal**.

   ![New Terminal is highlighted in the Terminal menu in Visual Studio Code.](media/vscode-terminal-menu.png "Visual Studio Code Terminal menu")

2. This will open a new bash terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code dialog.

3. Change directories to the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` folder by running the following command. **Important**: Be sure to include the quotes around the path, since it contains a space.

   ```bash
   cd "Hands-on lab/lab-files"
   ```

4. At the bash prompt, use the `npm install` command to ensure the required components are installed on your Lab VM.

   ```bash
   sudo npm install
   ```

   ![This is a screenshot of the terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code dialog box. The command above is entered at the command prompt, and the results of the command are displayed.](media/vscode-terminal-npm-install.png "Bash terminal window")

5. Next, enter the following to seed the local MongoDB database with plans, user accounts, and orders.

   ```bash
   node data/Seed.js
   ```

   ![The above command to seed the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-seedjs.png "Bash terminal window")

   > **Note**: If you receive an error that the service is not running, start the MongoDB service by executing the `sudo service mongod start` command at the shell prompt.

6. Next, build the application using the following:

   ```bash
   sudo npm run build
   ```

7. Finally, enter the following to start the web server for the application. You will see a `connection successful` message in the terminal window.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

8. Open a browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000> to view the landing page of the starter application. You will see three plans listed on the application home page, which are pulled from the local MongoDB database.

   ![Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the application home page.](media/bfyo-web-home.png "View the three plans")

9. Return to the VS Code integrated terminal window, and press **CTRL+C** to stop the application.

## Exercise 2: Migrate the database to Cosmos DB

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you update the starter application's database connection string to point to your Azure Cosmos DB account. You then, use `mongoimport.exe` to migrate the data in your MongoDB database into Cosmos DB collections, and verify with the application that you are connected to your Cosmos DB database.

### Task 1: Create and scale collections

In this task, you create the collections needed for your database migration and increase each collection's throughput from the default 400 RUs to 2,500 RUs. This is done to avoid throttling during the migration, and reduce the time required to import data.

> To learn more about RUs and throughput provisioning in Cosmos DB, read [Request Units in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/request-units).

1. Navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal by selecting **Resource groups** from the Azure home page, and then select the **best-for-you-db-SUFFIX** Azure Cosmos DB account resource from the list.

2. On the Cosmos DB blade, select **Data Explorer** from the left-hand menu and then select **New Collection**.

   ![Data Explorer is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu of the Azure portal, and New Collection is highlighted on the right.](media/cosmos-db-add-collection.png "Azure Cosmos DB")

3. In the **Add Collection** dialog, enter the following:

   - **Database id**: Choose **Create new**, and enter **best-for-you-organics**.
   - **Provision database throughput**: Uncheck this box.
   - **Collection id**: Enter **orders**.
   - **Storage capacity**: Select **Fixed (10 GB)**.
   - **Throughput**: Enter **2500**.
   - Select **OK** to create the collection.

   ![The information above is entered in the Add Collection dialog box.](media/cosmos-db-new-collection-orders.png "Add Collection")

4. On the Collections blade, select **New Collection** again to create another collection.

   ![The New Collection button is highlighted on the Cosmos DB Collections blade.](media/cosmos-db-new-collection.png "New Collection")

5. On the Add Collection dialog, enter the following:

>**Change #02:** Sharding definition is now required: for "users" collections you can use  "postalCode". For "plans" you can use "portionSize".

   - **Database id**: Select **Use existing** and select the **best-for-you-organics** database from the list.
   - **Collection id**: Enter **users**.
   - **Storage capacity**: Select **Fixed (10 GB)**.
   - **Throughput**: Enter **2500**.
   - Select **OK** to create the collection.

   ![The information for the users collection above is entered into the Add Collection dialog.](media/cosmos-db-new-collection-users.png "Add Collection")

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5, this time entering **plans** as the collection name.

7. The best-for-you-organics database will have three collections listed under it when you are complete.

   ![The best-for-you-organics database is displayed, with orders, plans, and users collections under it.](media/cosmos-db-database-and-collections.png "Cosmos DB Collections")

### Task 2: Update database connection string

In this task, you will retrieve the connection string for your Azure Cosmos DB database and update the starter application's database connection string.

1. On the **Azure Cosmos DB account** blade, select **Connection String** under **Settings** in the left-hand menu, and copy the **PRIMARY connection string**.

   ![Connection String is selected under Settings on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade, and the Primary Connection String value is highlighted on the Read-write Keys tab on the right.](media/cosmos-db-connection-strings.png "Azure cosmos DB account blade")

2. Return to VS Code.

3. Open `app.js` from the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` directory of the application and locate the line that starts with **var databaseUrl** (line 16).

   ![App.js is selected and highlighted in the Explorer pane in the Visual Studio Code window, and the line starting with var databaseUrl is highlighted on the right.](media/vscode-app-js-database-url.png "Visual Studio Code window")

4. Replace the value of the **databaseUrl** variable with the Cosmos DB connection string you copied from the Azure portal.

   ![The value of the databaseUrl variable is displayed in the Visual Studio Code window.](media/vscode-app-js-connection-string.png "Visual Studio Code window")

5. The connection string copied from the portal does not specify the name of the database, so you now need to add that to the connection string. Scroll to the end of the value you just pasted in and locate **10255/?ssl=** in the string.

   ![10255/?ssl= is highlighted in the string in the Visual Studio Code window.](media/vscode-app-js-connection-string-database-name-position.png "Visual Studio Code window")

6. Between the "/" and the "?" insert **best-for-you-organics** to specify the database name.

   ![best-for-you-organics is selected in the string in the Visual Studio Code window.](media/vscode-app-js-connection-string-database-name.png "Visual Studio Code window")

7. Save `app.js`.

8. In the VS Code integrated terminal, enter the following command to rebuild the application:

> **Change #03**: check if you are on the directory: demouser@LabVM:~/MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps/Hands-on lab/lab-files$ sudo npm run build

   ```bash
   sudo npm run build
   ```

9. When the build completes, start the application by typing the following:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

10. Return to your browser and refresh the application page. Note: You may need to press **CTRL+F5** in your browser window to clear the browser cache while refreshing the page.

    ![This is a screenshot of the refreshed application page.](media/bfyo-web-home-empty.png "Refreshed application screenshot")

    > **Note**: Notice the three plans that were displayed on the page previously are no longer there. The application is now pointing to your Azure Cosmos DB, and the plans collection does not contain any data yet.

11. Now, let's move on to copying the data from the local MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB.

### Task 3: Import data to the API for MongoDB using mongoimport

In this task, you will use `mongoimport.exe` to import data to your Cosmos DB account. There is a shell script located in the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` project, which handles exporting the data out of your MongoDB into JSON files on the local file system. These files will be used for the import into Cosmos DB.

1. On your Lab VM, open a new integrated bash prompt in VS Code by selecting the **+** next to the shell dropdown in the integrated terminal pane.

   ![This is a screenshot of the terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code dialog box. The + button is highlighted.](media/vscode-terminal-new.png "Bash terminal window")

2. At the prompt, enter the following command to grant execute permissions on the export script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x "Hands-on lab/lab-files/data/mongo-export.sh"
   ```

3. Next, run the script by entering the following command:

   ```bash
   "Hands-on lab/lab-files/data/mongo-export.sh"
   ```

   ![The above command to export data from the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-mongo-export.png "Bash terminal window")

4. The script creates the folder ~/MongoExport, and exports each of the collections in your MongoDB to JSON files. Navigate to the MongoExport directory for your user account by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd ~/MongoExport
   ```

5. You are now ready to import the data into Azure Cosmos DB using `mongoimport.exe`.

6. You will use the following command template for executing the data import:

   ```bash
   mongoimport --host <your_hostname>:10255 -u <your_username> -p <your_password> --db <your_database> --collection <your_collection> --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file <your_collection>.json
   ```

7. To get the values needed for the template command above, return to the **Connection string** blade for your Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal. Leave this window up, as you will need the **HOST**, **USERNAME**, and **PRIMARY PASSWORD** values from this page to import data to your Cosmos DB account.

   ![Connection String is selected under Settings on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Read-write Keys tab on the right, the values under Host, Username, and Primary Password are highlighted.](media/cosmos-db-connection-strings-values.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

8. Replace the values as follows in the template command above:

   - `<your_hostname>`: Copy and paste the **Host** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection String** blade.
   - `<your_username>`: Copy and paste the **Username** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection String** blade.
   - `<your_password>`: Copy and paste the **Primary Password** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection** **String** blade.
   - `<your_database>`: Enter "best-for-you-organics"
   - `<your_collection>`: Enter "plans" (Note there are two instances of `<your-collection>` in the template command).

9. Your final command should look something like:

   ```bash
   mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection plans --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file plans.json
   ```

10. Copy and paste the final command at the command prompt to import the plans collection into Azure Cosmos DB.

    ![The final command to import the plans collection into Azure Cosmos DB is displayed in the Command Prompt window.](media/vscode-terminal-mongoimport.png "Bash terminal window")

    > **Note**: You will see a message indicating the number of documents imported, which should be 3 for plans.

11. Verify the import by selecting **Data Explorer** in your Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal, expanding plans, and selecting **Documents**. You will see the three documents imported listed.

    ![Data Explorer is selected and highlighted on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Collections blade, the turned delta next to plans is highlighted, and Documents is selected and highlighted below it. On the Mongo Documents tab to the right, the first of three imported documents is selected and highlighted.](media/cosmos-db-plans-documents.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

>**Change #04:** WARNING: --sslAllowInvalidCertificates and --sslAllowInvalidHostnames are deprecated, please use --tlsInsecure instead. Change from: --sslAllowInvalidCertificates to: --tlsInsecure to skip the warning.

12. Repeat step 8 for the users and orders collections, replacing the `<your_collection>` values with:

    - users:

    ```bash
    mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection users --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file users.json
    ```

    - orders:

    ```bash
    mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection orders --ssl --tlsInsecure --type json --file orders.json
    ```

13. To verify the starter application is now pulling properly from Azure Cosmos DB, return to your browser running the starter application (<http://localhost:3000>), and refresh the page. You should now see the three plans appear again on the home page. These were pulled from your Azure Cosmos DB database.

    ![Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the application home page.](media/bfyo-web-home.png "View the three plans")

14. You have successfully migrated the application and data to use Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB APIs.

15. Return to the Integrated terminal window of VS Code, which is running the application, and press **CTRL+C** to stop the application.

### Task 4: Install Azure Tools extensions for VS Code

In this task, you install the Azure Tools extensions for VS Code to take advantage of the integration with Azure Cosmos DB. This extension pack allows you to view and interact with your Cosmos DB databases, collections, and documents directly from VS Code.

1. Select the **Extensions** icon, enter "azure tools" into the search box, select the **Azure Tools** extension, and then select **Install** in the Extension: Azure Account window.

   ![The Extensions icon is highlighted on the left side of the VS Code window. On the right, "azure tools" is in the search box, Azure Tools is highlighted below it, and Install is highlighted on the right side.](media/vscode-extensions-cosmosdb.png "Install the Azure Tools extensions")

2. In the left-hand menu of VS Code, you should now see an Azure icon. Select that, and then select **Sign in to Azure**.

   ![Sign in to Azure is highlighted below AZURE COSMOS DB in the bottom left-hand corner of Visual Studio Code window.](media/vscode-azure-sign-in.png "Sign in to Azure")

   > **Note**: If you don't see the Azure icon, restart VS Code, and reopen the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` project folder.

3. Enter your Azure account credentials in the browser window that appears.

4. If presented with a prompt to enter a password for a new keyring, enter "**Password.1!!**" as the password and select **Continue**.

   ![Choose password for new keyring dialog, with Password.1!! entered in the password and confirm boxes.](media/ubuntu-new-keyring.png "Choose password window")

5. Once you have signed in, you will receive a message that you can close the browser window.

6. Back in VS Code, you should now see your Azure account listed under Azure Cosmos DB, along with your Azure account email listed in the status bar of VS Code.

   ![Your Azure account is listed under Azure Cosmos DB, and your Azure email is listed in the status bar of the Visual Studio Code window.](media/vscode-azure-cosmosdb.png "Azure Cosmos DB window")

7. From here, you can view your databases, collections, and documents, as well as edit documents directly in VS Code, and push the updated documents back into your database.

### Task 5: Decrease collection throughput

In this task, you will decrease the throughput of your collections. Azure Cosmos DB uses an hourly billing rate, so reducing the throughput after the data migration will help save costs.

1. From the Azure Cosmos DB menu pane in Visual Studio Code, right-click on the **best-for-you-db** database and then select **Open in Portal**.

   ![Open in Portal is highlighted in the best-for-you-db content menu.](media/vscode-azure-cosmosdb-open-in-portal.png "Cosmos DB")

2. In the Azure portal, select **Scale** from the left-hand menu, under **Collections** on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade.

3. Expand the **orders** collection and select **Scale & Settings**.

4. Change the **Throughput** value to **400** and select **Save**.

   ![Scale is selected and highlighted on the left side of the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Collections blade, Scale & Settings is selected and highlighted below orders. On the Scale & Settings tab to the right, 400 is entered and highlighted in the Throughput box, and the Save icon is highlighted above it.](media/cosmos-db-scale.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 for the **plans** and **users** collections.

## Exercise 3: Containerize the app

Duration: 30 minutes

This exercise walks you through containerizing the existing Best For You Organics Company MERN application using Docker, pushing the image to an **Azure Container Registry**, then deploying the image to **Web App for Containers** directly from VS Code.

### Task 1: Open Azure Container Registry with Docker extension in VS Code

The Docker extension for VS Code is used to simplify the management of local Docker images and commands, as well as the deployment of a built app image to Azure.

1. On your Lab VM, return to VS Code and the open `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` starter project.

2. You should see a Containers icon in the left-hand menu of Visual Studio Code. Select the **Containers** icon. Expand **Registries** and then expand **Azure**. If you do not see Azure listed, select **Connect registry** and select **Azure** from the list of registries. You should see the **bestforyouregistry** you created above listed.

   ![In the Docker VS Code extension, Registries and Azure are expanded, and the bestforyouregistry is highlighted.](media/vscode-extension-docker-registries.png "Docker extension")

   > **Note**: If you don't see the Containers icon in the left-hand menu, close and reopen VS Code, and the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` project.

### Task 2: Create a Docker image and run the app

In this task, you use VS Code and the Docker extension to add the necessary files to the project to create a custom Docker image for the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` app.

1. On your Lab VM, return to VS Code, and the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` project.

2. Open the VS Code Command Palette, by selecting **View** from the menu, then **Command Palette**.

3. Enter "add docker" into the Command Palette and select **Docker: Add docker files to workspace**.

   ![Docker: Add docker files to workspace is selected under add docker that is entered in the Command Palette.](media/vscode-command-palette-add-docker.png "Select Docker: Add docker files to workspace")

4. At the **Select Application Platform** prompt, select **Node.js**.

   ![Node.js is highlighted at the Select Application Platform prompt.](media/vscode-command-palette-app-platform.png "Select Node.js")

5. At the **Include optional Docker Compose files?** prompt, select **Yes**.

   ![Yes is highlighted at the Include optional Docker Compose files prompt.](media/vscode-command-palette-docker-compose.png "Include optional Docker Compose files")

6. Ensure port "3000" is entered on the next screen, and press **Enter**.

   ![3000 is selected in the field above What port does your app listen on?](media/vscode-command-palette-docker-port.png "Explorer")

7. This will add Dockerfile, along with several configuration files for Docker compose to the project.

   ![Dockerfile and several configuration files are highlighted in the Explorer pane.](media/vscode-docker-files.png "Explorer pane")

8. Select **Dockerfile** from the file navigator and observe the contents. This file provides the commands required to assemble a Docker image for the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` application.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Dockerfile contents. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](media/vscode-docker-file.png "Dockerfile screenshot")

9. Currently, the Docker extension for Visual Studio Code places the generated Docker files in the root directory of the project. Because the project files are all located in the `lab-files` directory, we need to move the generated files into that folder. Select the `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.debug.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `Dockerfile` files, and then drag and drop them into the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` folder. Respond Yes if prompted about moving the files.

   ![The docker files specified above are highlighted within the Hands-on lab/lab-files folder.](media/vscode-docker-move-files.png "Visual Studio Code files")

10. Next, you will tell Docker to build an image for your app. Select the **Terminal** menu in Visual Studio Code, and then select **New Terminal**.

    ![New Terminal is highlighted in the Terminal menu in Visual Studio Code.](media/vscode-terminal-menu.png "Visual Studio Code Terminal menu")

11. In the new terminal window, change the directory to the `Hands-on lab/lab-files` folder by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    cd "Hands-on lab/lab-files"
    ```

12. With the next command you will provide a **registry**, **image name**, and **tag**, using the following format. This format will allow the image to be pushed to your container registry.

>**Change #05:** You will need to enable **Admin user**.

    > `[registry]/[image name]:[tag]`

13. For this, you will need the Login server value from your Azure Container registry's **Access keys** blade.

    ![Access keys is selected under Settings on the Azure Container registry's Access keys blade, and on the right, bestforyouregistry.azurecr.io is highlighted in the Login server box on the right.](media/acr-login-server.png "Container registry blade")

14. At the terminal prompt, enter the following, where `[Login server]` is the Login server value from Azure:

    ```bash
    docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t [Login server]/best-for-you-organics:latest .
    ```

    > **Note**: Be sure to include the "." at the end of the line.

15. For example:

    ```bash
    docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t bestforyouregistry.azurecr.io/best-for-you-organics:latest .
    ```

16. Press **Enter**, which will trigger the build of the image. You will see the following output in the terminal window:

    ![The docker build command above is entered into the VS Code terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-docker-build.png "Docker build")

17. Once the build completes, select the **Docker** icon in the left-hand menu of Visual Studio Code and then expand **Images**. You will see the `best-for-you-organics` image.

    ![The image is highlighted in the DOCKER extension explorer under Images.](media/vscode-extensions-docker-images.png "Docker extension explorer")

18. You can also use the `docker images` command in the Integrated terminal to list the images.

    ![The docker images command is entered in the terminal window, with the list of images is displayed.](media/vscode-terminal-docker-images.png "Docker images")

### Task 3: Run the containerized app

In this task, you run the app from the container you built in the previous task.

1. In the **Images** area of the Docker extension in VS Code, expand the `best-for-you-organics` image and then right-click on the `latest` image and select **Run Interactive**.

   ![The image is selected in the Images area of the Docker extension explorer, and Run Interactive is highlighted in the shortcut menu.](media/vscode-extensions-docker-images-latest.png "Docker extension explorer")

   > **Note**: If you receive an error that the address is already in use, return to the terminal window where you ran the application using the `npm start` command and press `CTRL+C` to stop the application. Then, try the above action again.

2. Notice in the Interactive terminal that a docker run command is issued. Using the VS Code Docker extension, you can issue some docker commands without needing to work from the command line.

   ![The docker run command is highlighted in the Interactive terminal window.](media/vscode-terminal-docker-run.png "Interactive terminal window")

3. Verify the web app and container are functioning by opening a browser window and navigating to <http://localhost:3000>.

>**Change #07:** Note here that the login user is *user* and the password is *Password.1!!*.

   ![The Log in link is highlighted on the Welcome to Jenkins dialog.](media/jenkins-welcome-login.png "Welcome to Jenkins!")

5. On the Jenkins on Azure screen, you will see a message that this Jenkins instance does not support https, so logging in through a public IP address has been disabled. You will need to create an SSH tunnel to connect to the Jenkins instance securely.

6. To set up an SSH tunnel to Jenkins, copy the ssh command provided in the Jenkins on Azure window, as highlighted in the screenshot below.

7. Open a new bash shell, and at the command prompt paste the copied ssh command, replacing "username" with **jenkinsadmin**. The command will resemble the following:

>**Change #08**: Again the user here could be *bitnami*.

   ```bash
   ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:localhost:8080 jenkinsadmin@jenkins-kb.westus.cloudapp.azure.com
   ```

8. If prompted that authenticity of the Jenkins host cannot be established, enter "yes" to continue.

9. Enter the **jenkinsadmin** password, "Password.1!!"

   ![The ssh command above is highlighted in the bash window, and yes is highlighted next to Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?](media/bash-jenkins-ssh-tunnel.png "bash window")

    ![The committed changes are displayed on the build page.](media/jenkins-build-history-details.png "Build page")

14. You have successfully set up your CI pipeline.

### Task 6: Install Docker on the Jenkins VM

In this task, you install Docker CE on your Jenkins VM, so it can be used to build images from the build artifacts produced by your CI build.

1. The first step is to ensure no older versions of Docker are installed on your Jenkins VM. Using the SSH tunnel bash terminal you opened previously, navigate to the command prompt, and enter:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
   ```

2. Next, you need to set up a Docker repository on the host machine. The begin, update the `apt` package index:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

3. Install the necessary packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS, entering `y` when prompted to continue.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install \
   apt-transport-https \
   ca-certificates \
   curl \
   software-properties-common \
   gpg-agent
   ```

>**Note:** Sometime when we copy and paste the multi-line command we have issues. You can it a single line or copy and paste this bellow.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common gpg-agent
   ```

4. Add Docker's official GPG key.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

5. Verify that you now have the key with fingerprint `9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88`, by searching for the last eight characters of the fingerprint:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
   ```

6. You should see output similar to:

   ```bash
   pub   4096R/0EBFCD88 2017-02-22
       Key fingerprint = 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
   uid                  Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
   sub   4096R/F273FCD8 2017-02-22
   ```

7. Next, enter the following commands to set up the **stable** repository.

   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
   ```

8. You are now ready to install Docker CE. Start by updating the `apt` package index.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

9. Install the latest version of Docker IO, entering `y` when prompted to continue.

>**Change #10:** Docker-ce to Docker.io

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install docker.io
   ```

10. Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly by running the `hello-world` image.

    ```bash
    sudo docker run hello-world
    ```

    ![Hello world message from Docker on the Jenkins server.](media/bash-jenkins-docker-hello-world.png "Jenkins Docker install")

11. The final step is to add permission to the `jenkins` user to Docker.

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins
    sudo chmod 664 /run/docker.sock
    ```

12. Now, restart the Jenkins service, entering the jenkinsadmin password, `Password.1!!`, when prompted.

>**Change #11:** We can restart Jenkins via Web, or via command line. 
    ```bash
    sudo service bitnami restart
    #service jenkins restart this way is not supported.
    tail -f /opt/bitnami/jenkins/jenkins.logs
    ```

### Task 7: Add continuous delivery to Jenkins build job

In this task, you add continuous deployment (CD) to the Jenkins build pipeline. This uses a post-build action to create a new Docker image from the build, push that image to your Azure Container Registry, and deploy the image to your Web App for Containers instance.

1. In a new browser window, navigate to your Container registry in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by selecting **Resource groups** from the Azure services list, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group from the list, and then selecting the **Container registry** resource.

2. On the Container registry blade, select **Access keys** from the left-hand menu and leave this page open for the following steps.

3. Restarting the Jenkins service terminates any existing connections. Return to your **Jenkins** dashboard and select **Log in** on the toolbar.

4. On the login screen, enter the following:

   - **Username**: admin
   - **Password**: Enter the initial admin password you copied into a text editor previously.

   > As a reminder, the initial admin password was retrieved by executing the following command from the SSH tunnel bash window: `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`

5. Once logged back in, select the **best-for-you-build** project. When prompted to log in, use the initial admin password you retrieve in the bash shell previously and copied into a text editor.

   ![The best-for-you-build project is highlighted on the Jenkins dashboard.](media/jenkins-dashboard-best-for-you-build.png "Jenkins dashboard")

6. Select **Configure** from the left-hand menu.

   ![Configure is highlighted in the left-hand menu.](media/jenkins-project-configure.png "Jenkins left-hand menu")

7. On the configure screen, scroll down to the Build section and select the Execute shell block you created previously.

8. Return to the Container registry Access keys blade in the Azure portal, copy the values specified below and paste them into the appropriate values in the `docker build` command below.

   - **Login server**: Copy the Azure Container Registry's Login server value, and paste into the command below as the `ACR_URL` value.
   - **Username**: Copy the Username value for your Azure Container Registry, and paste into the command below as the `ACR_USERNAME` value.
   - **Password**: Enter the password value for your Azure Container Registry, and paste into the command below as the `ACR_PASSWORD` value.

     ![In the Container Registry Access keys blade, the Login Server, Username, and password fields are highlighted.](media/azure-container-registry-access-keys.png "Container Registry Access keys")

   ```bash
   ACR_URL="<your-container-registry-login-server>"
   ACR_USERNAME="<your-container-registry-username>"
   ACR_PASSWORD="<your-container-registry-password>"

   docker build --tag "${ACR_URL}/best-for-you-organics:latest" .
   docker login $ACR_URL --username $ACR_USERNAME --password $ACR_PASSWORD
   docker push "${ACR_URL}/best-for-you-organics:latest"
   ```

9. You final command should look similar to the following:

   ```bash
   ACR_URL="bestforyouregistrykb.azurecr.io"
   ACR_USERNAME="bestforyouregistrykb"
   ACR_PASSWORD="uddDqqTdBdxaI=QMmTqTfAg75cJHnfcj"

   docker build --tag "${ACR_URL}/best-for-you-organics:latest" .
   docker login $ACR_URL --username $ACR_USERNAME --password $ACR_PASSWORD
   docker push "${ACR_URL}/best-for-you-organics:latest"
   ```

10. Copy the completed command text and paste it below the `npm run build` line within the Execute shell Command box. The Execute shell command should now look similar to the following:

    ![The command above is appended to the execute shell command.](media/jenkins-execute-shell-command-cd.png "Execute shell")

11. Select **Save**.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Save (selected) and Apply buttons.](media/jenkins-save.png "Select Save")

### Task 8: Trigger CI-CD pipeline

In this task, you commit changes to the `MCW-OSS-PaaS-and-DevOps` starter application and trigger the full CI/CD pipeline through Jenkins, resulting in the updated application being added to a new Docker image, pushed to ACR, and deployed to Web App for Containers.

1. Return to VS Code on your Lab VM, open the `.dockerignore` file, and delete the line containing **DockerFile\*** from the file. This will allow Jenkins to use the file to build the container in the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

2. Next, open the `src/components/plan/Plans.js` file, and insert the following markup between `<div class="container">` and `<Grid>`:

   ```html
   <h3>Welcome to Best For You Organics Company</h3>
   ```

   ![The src/components/plan/Plans.js file is highlighted on the left side of Visual Studio Code, and the markup above is highlighted on the right.](media/vscode-plans-js.png "VS Code")

3. Save the updated files.

>**Change #12:** Make sure to modify the /var/run/docker.sock on the jenkins VM. sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock

4. As you did in [Task 4](#task-4-trigger-ci-build), above, select the **Source Control icon** from the left-hand menu, enter a commit comment, select **+** to stage the change, and select the **checkmark** to commit the change, and push to GitHub. Enter your credentials if prompted. This will trigger the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

   ![The updated files are listed under Staged Changes in VS Code, and a commit comment is entered.](media/visual-studio-code-cd-file-updates-commit.png "Visual Studio Code")

5. Return to your Jenkins dashboard, and select the **best-for-you-build** project, and select the latest build number under Build History.

   ![The Jenkins build history is displayed, with a progress bar next to #2.](media/jenkins-build-history.png "Jenkins build history")

6. On the Build page, select **Console Output** from the left-hand menu.

   ![Console Output is highlighted in the left-hand menu on the Jenkins project build page.](media/jenkins-build-console-output.png "Build console output")

7. On the Console Output page, you can monitor the build progress. When it completes after a few minutes, you will see a SUCCESS message similar to the following:

   ![A build and Docker deployment success message is displayed in the console output in Jenkins.](media/jenkins-build-console-output-success.png "Build and Docker deployment success")

8. When the deployment is complete, you can verify the changes deployed successfully by navigating to your Web App for Containers instance in **hands-on-lab-web-SUFFIX** resource group in the Azure portal and selecting the URL on the overview blade. The deployment of the container can take several minutes to complete, so refreshes may take a few minutes to show the new header.

   > **Tip**: It may help to open the app in an Incognito or InPrivate browser window, as the old page may be cached.

9. You should see the home page, with a new header above the three plans on the page.

   ![Welcome to Best for You Organics Company! is highlighted above the Two-Person Plan, Four-Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes in this screenshot of the home page.](media/bfyo-web-welcome.png "Home page")

## Exercise 6: Create Azure Functions for order processing

Duration: 45 minutes

In this task, you create the Azure Functions that handle order processing. The first function sends unprocessed order details into a storage queue. This function uses a timer trigger and checks the processed field on order documents, ensuring only unprocessed orders are sent to the processing queue. A second function simulates order processing and sends notifications to the user who placed the order.

### Task 1: Configure storage queues

In this task, you add two storage queues to the storage account provisioned when you created your Function App. These queues are used to store orders and notifications that need to be processed.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list and then select the **hands-on-lab-func-SUFFIX** resource group.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

    ![Code + Test is highlighted under Developer on the Azure Function menu.](media/function-app-code-test.png "Function Code + Test")

18. To get the code for the `OrdersTimerTrigger` function, go into the project in VS Code, expand the `Hands-on lab/lab-files/AzureFunctions` folder, and open the `OrdersTimerTrigger.js` file.

19. Replace the `uri` variable value on line 4 of the `OrdersTriggerTimer.js` file with the primary connection string for your Cosmos DB, which you can retrieve from the Connection String blade of your Azure Cosmos DB account.

    ![The Azure Cosmos DB account connection string blade is displayed, and the primary connection string is highlighted.](media/cosmos-db-connection-string.png "Connection string")

20. Copy all of the code within the file.

21. Return to your `OrdersTimerTrigger` function in the Azure portal and paste the code into the `index.js` block, overwriting all the existing code. Your `index.js` file should now look like the following:

    ![This is a screenshot of the index.js block.](media/function-app-index-js.png "Index.js block")

22. Select **Save** on the Function toolbar.

    ![The Save button is highlighted on the Function toolbar.](media/function-app-save-code.png "Function App toolbar")

    ![Two Person Plan, High-Pro Plan, and Four Person Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the home page, and all three boxes' Select this plan buttons are highlighted.](media/bfyo-web-plans.png "Select a plan")

28. On the **Place Order** screen, select **Place Order**. This will create a new order in the Cosmos DB `orders` collection. Within 5 minutes, the Timer trigger of your function will fire and then send the order on to the `orderqueue` for processing.

    ![The Place Order button is highlighted at the bottom of the Place Order page.](media/bfyo-place-order.png "Place your order page")

29. Finally, verify items are being written to the order queue, by going to the queue in the Azure Storage account, and observing that items have been added to the `orderqueue`.

    ![The Refresh button is highlighted in the Azure Storage account, and Message Text appears in the order queue below.](media/storage-queue-items.png "Messages blade")

### Task 3: Create Queue function

In this task, you create a second function, which is triggered by the output of the OrdersTimerTrigger function. This simulates the order processing and adds items to the notificationqueue if the order processing is complete, and the `sendNotifications` property is true for the order.

This uses an Azure Storage Queue trigger, and an input dataset from Cosmos DB, pulling in customers. The output dataset is the Azure Cosmos DB orders table. The update sets `processed = true` and the `processedDate` to today's date.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **bestforyouorders** Function app, select **Functions** from the left-hand menu and then select **+ Add**.

   ![Functions is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu on the Function Apps blade, and + Add is highlighted on the right.](media/function-app-new.png "Function Apps blade")

   ![This is a screenshot of the Queue trigger box.](media/azure-queue-storage-trigger.png "Queue trigger box")

3. On the **Queue trigger New Function** dialog, enter the following:

   - **New Function:** Enter `ProcessOrders`.
   - **Queue name:** Enter `orderqueue`.
   - **Storage account connection:** Select **AzureWebJobsStorage**.
   - Select **Create Function**.

   ![The information above is entered in the Queue trigger New Function dialog box.](media/process-orders-function.png "Queue trigger New Function dialog box")

4. When the function has been created, select **Integration** on the ProcessOrders Function blade.

   ![Integration is selected and highlighted under the new function.](media/function-app-integrate.png "New function menu")

5. On the Integration blade, select **Azure Queue Storage (myQueueItem)** under **Trigger**.

   ![The Integration blade of the ProcessOrders function is displayed and the Azure Queue Storage (myQueueItem) trigger is highlighted.](media/function-integration-process-orders.png "Function Integration")

6. On the Edit Trigger dialog, change the Message parameter name to "orderToProcess" and select **Save**.

   ![The value of "orderToProcess" is highlighted in the Message parameter name box on the Edit Trigger dialog.](media/function-app-integrate-process-orders.png "Azure Queue Storage trigger section")

7. Now, select **+ Add output**

   ![+ Add output in highlighted under Outputs on the Integration blade of the ProcessOrders function.](media/function-app-process-orders-add-output.png "Integration Outputs")

8. On the Create Output dialog, enter the following:

   - **Binding Type**: Select **Azure Queue Storage**.
   - **Message parameter name**: Enter `outputQueue`.
   - **Queue name:** Enter `notificationqueue` (all lowercase, as casing matters).
   - **Storage account collection:** Select **AzureWebJobsStorage** from the list.
   - Select **OK**.

   ![The information above is entered in the Azure Queue Storage output dialog box.](media/function-app-azure-queue-storage-output.png "Azure Queue Storage output dialog box")
